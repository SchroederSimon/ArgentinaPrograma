I developed a web application that utilizes Firebase for database management, authentication, and route protection. The Firebase requests are handled through services (CRUD, Auth, AuthGuard). Users must first log in with a correct email address to access the portfolio editing feature. Users can add skills and upload images to the database in base64 format to be displayed as an icon for each skill. The application also supports skill deletion and editing, and I made every effort to ensure the design is responsive across various devices. The contact form is also functional and users can send emails using emailjs.
